This guy thought he was the king of Minecraft, until I showed up.

I started off by stealing all his diamonds. Poor guy didn't see it coming.

But that was just the beginning of my epic trolling spree.

I built a giant pixelated chicken right in the middle of his house. He was furious!

Next, I filled his entire base with water, turning it into an underwater fortress. He couldn't believe his eyes.

But the ultimate prank was yet to come. I rigged his entire inventory to explode. Boom!

Needless to say, he learned his lesson. Don't mess with the master of Minecraft trolling!
